# coms309_codeReference
Hey, if you're taking coms309 in Fall 2021, you might've come here for code reference. Email me at saltaf@iastate.edu if you have any questions about the code

# If you're scratching your head wondering where to start from here's my suggested sequence of how to go about it:


Here's the link for the channel where you'll find all the videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtr5RNPZNpw9tgj3Dxp5sNQ

# NOTE: To maximize learning, install the android studio beforehand and work alongside the videos and write the code yourselves


# For those just getting started start with these two
 - 1 - Android Studio Basics part 1
 - 2 - Android Studio Basics part 2

# If you are confident enough to work with activities, views and emulator, (if not watch the two vids above) watch these to learn how to make api calls. If you just want to know how to work with the existing repo, watch pt 3, it is an overview of how to create a new data class, create its api client and methods, and successfully make api calls in acitivities
 - 1 - Android Studio - Basic Api Calls pt 1
 - 2 - Android Studio - Basic Api Calls pt 2
 - 3 - Android Studio - Basic Api Calls pt 3 - /// STILL INCOMPLETE: TODO

# Once you are confident enough and think you can make api calls (watch the videos above if you can't), then you can began making a round trip:
 - 1 - Springboot - Trivia app backend with h2
 - 2 - Android Studio - Trivia app api calls and activity
